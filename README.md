# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using supervised machine learning.  
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle ("House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques").  
A Linear Regression model was implemented to estimate prices based on features such as location, number of rooms, and property size.

## Project Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature selection  
4. Model training (Linear Regression)  
5. Model evaluation (MAE, MSE, RÂ², Cross-Validation)
